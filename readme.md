# Halo3 DLL Ideas #
write down your ideas

1.) There‚Äôs a weird issue with the 30 tick dll mod. So, when you crouch in the air, the screen/your character‚Äôs legs does this weird jittering and I‚Äôm not sure what the reason is. On 60 tick, there‚Äôs no issues, but on 30 tick there is. Especially in theater, you'll see a crazy big difference in playback in regards to the jittery-ness. Half my team find the 30 tick dll mod unplayable, because they think it‚Äôs beyond distracting. It would be cool to get the game to visually look like 60 tick, while using the 30 tick dll mod.

2.) Shorten weapon grab delay by half the time.

3.) We discussed the ‚Äúbroad stroke physics collision‚Äù note I found from someone in a modding discord. You said that you can‚Äôt modify the dll to respond to something that doesn‚Äôt have a physics model. Which I understand that. The object(s) I‚Äôm referring to are objects that just don‚Äôt respond to bipeds or crates when they touch. They have a physics model, just only responds to melees and map geometry. If you could find a way to make all crate objects respond to bipeds and other crates, that would be amazing. Then the need to edit each little object in the game wouldn‚Äôt be necessary.

4.) This one is a long shot I think. But I want to basically remove the rng from power drain explosions. Example‚Ä¶ if a power drain blows up next to a cone and you throw it in the same spot every time, the cone will have a few different outcomes. If you use a grenade next to a cone, the outcome doesn‚Äôt change. I basically want the power drain to respond like a grenade, in the sense that it has one explosion outcome. I‚Äôve tried editing the tag and finding a way to fix it and I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me figure it out and I‚Äôm pretty good at tag editing. I‚Äôm either missing something obvious or it‚Äôs just not possible without a dll mod. For all I know, there might already only be one type of outcome and there‚Äôs rng for some other reason. I‚Äôm not sure.

(UPDATE 1/24/23) You tried, I had an idea if you ever wanted to tackle it again. "well, if you ever wanted to, the next thing to try would be to make the power drain roll next to objects the same way grenades do so that they don't make the objects stutter. That's the main thing I think may be the culprit at this point".

5.) The savestate crash fix you provided, causes an issue with playing with other people. It would be cool to solve this issue, along with possibly allowing us to use the save state script in the the same game with other people. I know campaign and multiplayer are different, but if you could possibly get the multiplayer maps to respond the same as campaign in regards to checkpoints so we can play with other people and use the script consistently, would be a game changer.

6.) 30 Tick DLL for Halo Reach

7.) Save map file names/game variant names to whatever you like with no limitations. Sometimes you make innocent names and the game is like (stop using profanity nerd).

8.) Unlimited theater files.

9.) Invincibility in campaign

10.) You fixed forge falling speed, however there's one slight difference. When you go into forge from a stationary position, you're able to jump in the air immediately out of forge. The DLL modification fixes the falling speed, but it's not starting you from a completely stationary position every time. Initially I thought the falling speed had everything to do with it, but there's a bit more to it come to find out. But yea, if there's a possibility to make it so that you start stationary every time, would work better, if not, it's fine the way it currently is!

11.) Make 10 sensitivity automatically 12 sensitivity.

12.) being able to reverse campaign theater files because they can only currently move forward, not backward.

13.) The game doesn‚Äôt store your recent theater file in local low, unless you physically enter the theater menu and let the files populate first in game. I wonder if there‚Äôs a way you could just have the files automatically be sent without having to load the theater menu first?
